                        Pentatonix are not just a cover band. Many of the original music of the album are highlights just as much as the covers. ‘Hey Momma/Hit The Road Jack’, is an interesting fusion of old and new, being a mash-up of the group’s own words and the classic song ‘Hit The Road Jack’ as the chorus. ‘Run to You’ also stands out – being in the middle of the album, giving a breather from the pumping bass and rap. Acapella in its purest form, there is nothing but harmony in the song; a sombre and somewhat chilling track that will give you shivers. (Redbrick)<br>

                        PTX, Vol. III (Volume 3) is the fourth extended play album by the a cappella group Pentatonix. The extended play contains four covers as well as three original tracks ("On My Way Home", "See Through" and "Standing By"). As of October 23, 2015, PTX, Vol. III has sold 201,226 copies.(Wikipedia)<br>
                        The mere five members of Pentatonix do an amazing job at creating a complete sound without a single instrument, making their music sound clean and pure. All members of the group have their own vocal range and talent, and the way their voices cooperate and braid with each other creates total ear candy that makes your whole body happy. Pentatonix has given a cappella the comeback it needs and deserves, and I think it’s here to stay.(The Journal Rewired)<br>

                        A Pentatonix Christmas is the fifth studio album by American a cappella group Pentatonix. It is also their second full-length holiday album since That's Christmas to Me in 2014. Featuring two new original songs, "Good to Be Bad" and "The Christmas Sing-Along", A Pentatonix Christmas debuted on the Billboard 200 at number three with 52,000 albums sold in its first week, and later peaked at number one, selling 206,000 units in its best week. A Pentatonix Christmas marks as their second number one album on the Billboard 200 after Pentatonix. The album also debuted atop the Billboard Holiday Albums chart, their second number one on that chart after That's Christmas to Me. The deluxe edition of the album dropped from number 6 to 200 on the Billboard 200 in 2018, the greatest drop for an album that still remained on the chart, in Billboard history. The album also, with a guest appearance by The Manhattan Transfer, marked the first recording by the fourth iteration of the group, as this was Trist Curless' first participation with the group in a recording since the death of Tim Hauser, whom Curless officially replaced in 2014. As of November 2017, 938,000 units of A Pentatonix Christmas have been sold in the US and 1,400,000 units worldwide. A deluxe edition was released on October 20, 2017, almost a year after the original's release. The deluxe edition additionally marks the first appearance of replacement bass Matt Sallee and the second to last appearance of Avi Kaplan.(Wikipedia)<br>

                        <strong>Description:</strong><br>
                        PTX, Vol. IV: Classics is the fifth extended play album by the a cappella group Pentatonix. It is their final release with original member Avi Kaplan, who left the group later that year.Their second work after PTXmas to not feature any original material, the album marks a departure from the group's typical sound, which mostly consists of either modern pop songs or Christmas music, choosing instead to focus on standards of rock, blues, country, and older pop music. "Jolene", featuring the original artist, Dolly Parton, earned her and Pentatonix a Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance. The group's cover of "Jolene", originally released as a single and later included in the EP, was particularly praised. Julia Brucculieri of The Huffington Post called the version "a hauntingly beautiful a cappella update" Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal called it a "stellar version", stating that "Pentatonix proves yet again that they can do no wrong with anything they sing or cover. The addition of Dolly Parton helps elevate 'Jolene' to a higher level, and they prove that it is possible for heaven to be a place on earth. Their a cappella rendition earns five out of five stars." Stefan Kyriazis of the Daily Express called it a "remarkable new version of the old standard. 'Jolene' was released way back in 1973 but has never sounded fresher."(Wikipedia)<br>

                        PTX Presents: Top Pop, Vol. I is the sixth studio album by American a cappella group Pentatonix. It is their first album with bass vocalist Matt Sallee, and without original bass vocalist Avi Kaplan. It is also their first full-length album not to feature any original material. Three singles from the album were released before the release: "Havana" on February 23, 2018, "New Rules x Are You That Somebody?" on March 9, and "Attention" on March 23. Pentatonix released a performance of a mashup of songs on the album on YouTube on April 19, 2018. AllMusic gave the album a rating of 3 out of 5, stating "Make no mistake, [Pentatonix] are still proudly the children of Glee, but that's also the ace up their sleeve: they're flashy about their hip attributes, which helps disguise how this album is -- at its core -- music by a very good music theater troupe."

                        The Best of Pentatonix Christmas is the first compilation album by American a cappella group Pentatonix. It contains Christmas songs, originally recorded for and included in their holiday albums PTXmas, That's Christmas to Me, A Pentatonix Christmas and Christmas Is Here!, as well as four new songs: Do You Hear What I Hear?, God Only Knows, Joyful, Joyful, and You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch. In December 2019, the group toured the United States in support of the album.(Wikipedia) Whatever the reason, Pentatonix has proven themselves the lords of a cappella holiday albums, and they have managed to keep that title with this latest project. May your days be merry and bright as you listen to this record and think back on all the times Pentatonix has kept your Christmas cheerful, or at least musical. (My Met Media)<br>

                        Scott Hoying says "Arranging and recording an EP's-worth of music and videos without once being in the same room as your bandmates or a producer was super challenging and definitely bizarre, but I know that collectively we were inspired by the strength, creativity and resourcefulness of people around the globe throughout the past months. We are so very proud to be able to share this music and these videos with our fans and can't wait for them to hear what else we've been up to!" The EP features six new tracks, including vocal arrangements of hits by The Weeknd, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Clean Bandit and The Cranberries, as well as a 13-song medley "Home," which pulls classic, home-inspired music and lyrics from Madness, Michael Bublé, Fifth Harmony, Flo Rida, Ozzy Ozbourne, Mötley Crüe and more.

                        The world is certainly a lonely place. As we’ve seen over the last 12 months, lack of real, authentic human connection has provoked deep reflection and personal transformation. For Pentatonix, known for their explosive live performances you can’t get with any other act, such forced self-examination was a long time coming. “As much as we do enjoy performing and traveling, there’s no time to figure things out. We’re always giving so much,” offers Grassi, taking a deep-chested breath. “In a way, it feels as though our break came at a good time because we’re all in our early 30s, or just about, and this is the time when you really figure out what you want in life.”(American Songwriter)<br>
